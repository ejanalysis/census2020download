Description: Creates block datasets for use in the EJAM package.
  Has basic functions for downloading from FTP, 
  unzipping, reading the 2020 Census data for some or all US States 
  into a single data.frame. It creates a dataset of all US blocks
  with a few key variables like population count, lat/lon of internal point, 
  FIPS. It downloads and also could retain some other columns like 
  area, and some basic race ethnicity counts,
  with small changes to some source code.
