Description: This package has basic functions for downloading from FTP, 
  unzipping, reading the 2020 Census data for some or all US States 
  into a single data.frame. It provides a dataset of all US blocks
  with a few key variables like population count, lat/lon of internal point, 
  FIPS. It downloads and also could retain some other columns like 
  area, and some basic race ethnicity counts,
  with small changes to some source code. 
  EPA may at some point provide the same data in a package such as EJAMblockdata.
