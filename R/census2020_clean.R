#' Start to clean up download block data
#' Renames columns, drops most, calculates total area.
#' @details 
#'   Renames and drops columns based on names in 
#'    [census_col_names_map] and the parameter cols_to_keep,
#'   but see census_col_names_map for what could be retained.
#'   
#'   Returns table in data.table format.
#'
#'   area is in square meters and is sum of land and water areas.
#'
#' @param x data from [census2020_read()]
#' @param cols_to_keep optional, which (renamed) columns to retain and return
#' @return data.table with these columns by default:  blockfips lat lon pop area
