# Download all Census 2020 blocks to use in EJAM

This package is just a set of helper functions used by the
[EJAM](https://ejanalysis.com/EJAM) package.

It creates block datasets (and some blockgroup tables) for use in the
EJAM package. It has basic functions for downloading from Census Bureau,
unzipping, reading the 2020 Census data for some or all US States into
data.table format. Also some limited tools for Island Areas
(VI,GU,MP,AS).

It can retain a few key variables like

- lat and lon of block internal point
- FIPS codes
- population count or weight
- area (or effective radius)

*Key functions and data.tables created include*

- [`census2020_get_data()`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/census2020_get_data.md)
  Download/ Unzip/ Read/ Clean data on all US Census blocks
- [`census2020_save_datasets()`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/census2020_save_datasets.md)
  Use the data to create separate data.tables, and save for use in the
  EJAM package.

*Key data.table objects created:*

- `blockid2fips` - data.table with FIPS code to blockid lookup
- `blockpoints` - data.table with latitude and longitude of internal
  points
- `quaddata` - data.table with xyz format locations of blocks, used to
  create spatial index of blocks in the EJAM package.
- `blockwts` - data.table with Census 2020 population-based weight as
  fraction of parent block group population, and size of block

## Key Functions

- [`census2020_get_data()`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/census2020_get_data.md)
  : Download and clean up US States,DC,PR, or Island Areas block data
  Census 2020 (for EJAM)
- [`census2020_save_datasets()`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/census2020_save_datasets.md)
  : Create separate data.tables, and optionally save them in the EJAM
  package This is just done when Census FIPS or bounds or points change.

## Datasets

- [`blockid2fips`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/blockid2fips.md)
  : Census FIPS code of each US Census 2020 block
- [`blockpoints`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/blockpoints.md)
  : lat/lon location of internal point of each Census 2020 block, used
  in EJAM package
- [`blockwts`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/blockwts.md)
  : 2020 Census block weights (population as share of overall block
  group)
- [`quaddata`](https://github.com/ejanalysis/census2020download/reference/quaddata.md)
  : xyz location of internal point of each Census 2020 block, for
  spatial index in EJAM
